# Jellyfin Related Hacks

Hacks I have created for my Linux-based Jellyfin server:

**keyworkSearch** - search the TV guide program data for shows with titles, subtitles, descriptions or cast/crew member names that match a set of regular expressions.  Schedule the shows that are found for recording.

**mkconfig** - make a XMLTV configuration file based on the channels that have been selected, i.e., not marked as ignored, on a Silicon Dust HDHomerun tuner.

**postprocessRecording** - post-process Live TV recordings to make them playable in the VLC player on the Nvidia Shield.  Also marks commercials as chapters in the video using the [Comskip](https://github.com/erikkaashoek/Comskip) application.
